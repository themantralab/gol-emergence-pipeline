# GoL Emergence Discovery System — Overarching Design

This document covers project-wide goals, architecture, design rationale,
and constraints. Stage-specific design details live in each stage's own
design document — this file is intentionally free of implementation specifics.

---

## 1. Project Goal

Build a two-model system that:
1. Learns a structured latent representation of Conway's Game of Life dynamics
2. Uses a conditioned latent diffusion model to sample novel regions of that
   latent space
3. Filters samples through an emergence pipeline to discover GoL configurations
   that are both mechanically valid (obey B3/S23) and behaviorally novel (do
   not match any known behavioral class in the training distribution)

The core research hypothesis: **a learned non-Gaussian sampler operating on a
structured, decorrelated latent space will discover emergent GoL structures more
efficiently than a Gaussian-prior VAE**, because GoL's interesting configurations
occupy thin, curved, non-Gaussian manifolds in configuration space that a
Gaussian prior systematically smooths over.

### System-wide no-Gaussian constraint

The system avoids Gaussian priors, assumptions, and structures in all **core
components**. This constraint is absolute for the three components where a
Gaussian assumption would directly bias which configurations are discovered:

1. **Latent space regularization** — no KL divergence, no unit Gaussian prior,
   no reparameterization trick (VICReg replaces all of these)
2. **Novelty scoring** — no centroid distance, no Gaussian cluster shape assumed;
   k-NN Euclidean distance against raw data points only
3. **Novelty scoring and emergence gate** — k-NN Euclidean distance against
   raw sig_reference data points; no cluster shape or distribution assumed

In **peripheral areas** (training utilities, visualization clustering,
normalization), Gaussian-adjacent methods are permitted when strictly necessary
or abundantly convenient, provided an explicit justification appears in the
relevant stage design document.

**Accepted Gaussian-adjacent elements and their justifications:**

| Element | Stage | Justification |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Gaussian noise in diffusion chain | 3 | Computational mechanism for training stability only; not a structural assumption about latent space |
| Ward linkage clustering | 1 | Minimizes within-cluster variance — a second-moment criterion, not a distributional assumption; chaining-resistant; visualization only |
| BatchNorm in encoder | 2 | Per-batch normalization for training stability; does not impose a Gaussian prior on learned representations |
| z_prior N(μ, diag(σ²)) for diffusion start | 3 | Eliminates inference-time z cloud dependency; valid approximation because VICReg already pushes z toward decorrelated near-unit-variance dimensions |

Any method not in the above table that assumes spherical clusters, unit Gaussian
priors, or normally distributed signal statistics in a core component violates
this constraint and must not be used without an explicit justification added to
the table above.

## 2. System Architecture Overview

The system has four sequential stages, each fully completed before the next begins:

```
[Stage 1 — Data Pipeline]        simulator.py, generate_data.py
           ↓
[Stage 2 — Core World Model]     model/, data_loader.py, train_core.py
           ↓  (frozen z cloud)
[Stage 3 — Latent Diffusion]     sampler/, train_sampler.py
           ↓  (z̃ samples)
[Stage 4 — Emergence Pipeline]   emergence/
```

### Why sequential and frozen

The core model (Stage 2) is frozen before the sampler (Stage 3) sees any data.
This means:
- The sampler cannot corrupt the world model's learned dynamics
- The latent space geometry is fixed and stable before the sampler learns it
- The two training objectives never interfere with each other

Stage 4 is inference-only — no training occurs; both frozen models are consumed.

### Key shared artifact: z_cloud.npy

`data/z_cloud.npy` is a matrix of encoded latent vectors — one per known GoL
configuration. It is **dynamic**: it starts as (N_SEEDS, 256) at the beginning
of Stage 3, built by passing all 1.5M training grids through the frozen Stage 2
encoder, and grows by one row per confirmed discovery throughout Stage 4.

Each confirmed discovery contributes `encoder(decode(z̃))` — the re-encoded
grid, not z̃ directly. This guarantees every vector in z_cloud came from the
encoder's learned manifold rather than a potentially off-manifold diffusion
output.

z_cloud serves two purposes:
1. **Stage 3 training corpus**: the diffusion sampler learns the geometry of
   this cloud and generates novel z̃ vectors near or beyond its boundaries.
2. **Stage 2 completion diagnostic**: t-SNE of a held-out subset must show
   visual cluster separation between behavioral classes before Stage 3 begins.

**Update cadence** (synchronized with sig_reference LOF):
- **Every confirmed discovery**: append `encoder(decode(z̃))` to z_cloud
- **Every 100 discoveries**: refit the Stage 3 conditioning LOF on the
  expanded z_cloud; retrain the Stage 3 denoiser on the expanded z_cloud
  with updated novelty scores. This causes the sampler to explore ever
  further from the combined known + discovered territory.

z_cloud is NOT used for the Stage 4 novelty gate — that role belongs to the
trajectory-signature LOF on sig_reference.

### Novelty mechanism: trajectory-signature LOF on sig_reference

Discovery is powered by the full behavioral evolution of a candidate pattern,
not by its position in latent space. The novelty chain for a candidate z̃:

```
z̃  ──decoder──▶  grid_candidate (128×128)
                        │
          simulator.simulate(grid_candidate, steps=256)   ← exact GoL physics
                        │
                (257, 128, 128) trajectory
                        │
          compute 10-signal array (257, 10)               ← same code as Stage 1
                        │
          rfft across time axis → (1290,) magnitude spectrum
                        │
          LOF against sig_reference.npy in full 1290D     ← no PCA
                        │
                  scalar novelty score
```

`data/sig_reference.npy` is the (N_SEEDS, 1290) behavioral archive from
Stage 1. It is the reference corpus for novelty scoring: every training
pattern's full temporal signature is encoded here. A candidate that evolves
differently from all 1.5M training patterns will have a large LOF score
in this space.

**Why raw 1290D LOF on sig_reference, not z-cloud LOF:**

An earlier design used LOF on z_cloud (z_0 vectors). This has a critical
weakness: z_0 is a snapshot of the initial grid. Two patterns with similar
initial structure but completely different long-term behavior — same z_0,
different trajectory — would score as similar. Discovery should be powered
by behavioral evolution, not initial appearance.

The previous attempt at FFT-fingerprint LOF (Stage 1 sanity check) failed
because PCA(50) was applied before LOF. PC1 of that reduction captured
population level ("alive vs dead"), causing gliders and oscillators to
collapse into the same density region. The failure was PCA, not the FFT
fingerprints. Raw 1290D LOF on sig_reference retains the full temporal
frequency structure of all 10 signals — including the drift signature of
Δcx/Δcy (which is near-zero for everything except gliders) and the lag
structure of S_lag_2/4/8/16 (which encodes oscillator period) — and
correctly separates these classes.

At inference time this is computationally tractable: one pattern at a time
is scored against the 1.5M-point reference using sklearn LOF with a Ball
Tree index.

N_SEEDS is set via `--n-seeds` CLI arg in generate_data.py (default 10,000;
production 1,500,000). All downstream stages read N from `data/n_seeds.npy` and
require no CLI args to adapt to different dataset sizes.

## 6. Key Design Decisions and Rationale

### Why no Gaussian prior?

Gaussian priors force the latent space into a unit Gaussian shape regardless
of what the data actually looks like. GoL behavioral classes occupy thin,
curved, non-Gaussian manifolds — a glider lives on a helix (limit cycle +
drift), an oscillator on a closed loop, a still life at a point attractor.
Forcing these onto a Gaussian prior destroys the geometric structure that
makes the latent space useful for sampling. VICReg enforces decorrelation
and prevents collapse without imposing any distributional shape.

### Why conditioned diffusion over blind diffusion?

Blind diffusion will oversample high-density regions of the z cloud — the
common patterns like simple still lifes and blinkers — and undersample the
sparse regions where interesting and rare structures live. The novelty
conditioning signal directly addresses this: it steers the reverse diffusion
process toward underexplored regions.

### Why short diffusion chain (T≈100) with a fitted z_prior?

The chain is short to avoid collapsing the starting distribution to pure N(0,I)
noise, which would force the model to learn a Gaussian approximation of the
true z distribution as a side effect of training. Instead, inference starts
from N(μ, diag(σ²)) fitted to the empirical z cloud — a lightweight two-row
file (`data/z_prior.npy`) that captures the actual per-dimension mean and
spread without requiring the full z cloud at inference time. This is a
deliberate peripheral Gaussian approximation: VICReg already drives the z cloud
toward decorrelated near-unit-variance dimensions, so the diagonal Gaussian fit
is a close approximation of the true marginal distribution. The Gaussian noise
within the chain is a computational mechanism (training stability), not a
structural statement about the latent space geometry.

### Why f_θ operates in latent space rather than pixel space?

Predicting next GoL states in pixel space directly would make f_θ responsible
for learning the encoder+rule+decoder simultaneously. In latent space, f_θ
only needs to learn the rule — the encoder and decoder handle the rest.
This separation of concerns makes each component learnable independently and
allows the contrastive and identity losses to operate directly on z vectors
rather than having to backpropagate through pixel-space reconstruction.

### Why separate training phases?

Mechanics must be accurate before identity training begins — the attractor head
trains on rollouts of f_θ, so if f_θ is wrong the identity signal is garbage.
The contrastive loss requires stable rollouts to produce meaningful triplets.
The phased curriculum enforces correct dependency ordering and prevents each
training objective from corrupting the others.

### Why 250 timesteps instead of 100?

250 timesteps gives:
- More room for slow methuselahs and complex patterns to develop
- Richer 10-signal signature curves with more temporal structure
- Better separation of behavioral classes that look similar at step 100
  (some period-N oscillators need N steps to complete a cycle)
- Longer lifespan to detect truly persistent structures

The cost is larger dataset files and slower signature extraction — manageable
on 32GB RAM with batch-wise processing.

### Why embed in 128×128 instead of simulating in 16×16?

Patterns need room to grow and travel. A glider moves ~1 cell per 4 steps;
over 250 steps it travels ~60 cells. A 16×16 grid would cause it to hit the
boundary immediately. The 128×128 grid gives patterns space to evolve naturally.
The 24-cell border around the 16×16 seed acts as a buffer.

### Why trajectory-signature LOF on sig_reference instead of z-cloud LOF?

Discovery must be powered by the full behavioral evolution of a pattern, not
by a snapshot of its initial encoding. z-cloud LOF operates on z_0 — the
encoder output for the initial grid. Two patterns with similar initial
structure but diverging long-term behavior would score as similar under z-cloud
LOF even if their 256-step signal trajectories are nothing alike. This is the
wrong basis for discovery.

Trajectory-signature LOF operates on the full (257, 10) signal trajectory,
compressed via FFT into a (1290,) fingerprint that captures the temporal
frequency content of all 10 signals simultaneously. This is the behavioral
fingerprint of the pattern across its entire evolution, not a snapshot.

The earlier attempt at FFT LOF (Stage 1 sanity check) failed because PCA(50)
was applied as a dimensionality reduction step before LOF. PC1 captured
population level, collapsing gliders and oscillators into the same density
region. The fix is to drop PCA entirely and run LOF in the full 1290D space.
At 1.5M reference points, sklearn LOF with Ball Tree makes this tractable.

z_cloud.npy is retained because Stage 3 (diffusion sampler) needs it as
training data — the sampler must learn the geometry of the latent space
to generate coherent z̃ vectors. The t-SNE diagnostic also uses z_cloud to
verify that the Stage 2 encoder has separated behavioral classes before
Stage 3 begins. z_cloud just no longer drives novelty scoring.

### Why LOF over k-NN distance?

Raw k-NN distance conflates sparsity with novelty: a point in a sparse but
internally consistent cluster scores high purely because the cluster is sparse,
not because the point is unusual relative to its neighbours. LOF compares each
point's local density to its neighbours' local densities — a point in a
consistently sparse neighbourhood scores ~1 (not novel), while a genuinely
isolated point scores high. This is the correct signal for discovery.

### Resolved — glider/oscillator separation

A LOF sanity check on `sig_reference` at the end of Stage 1 revealed that
gliders score as outliers at only 5.6% — indistinguishable from the 5% inlier
baseline. PC1 of PCA(50) on FFT fingerprints captured population level ("alive
vs dead"), causing gliders and oscillators to occupy the same density region.

**Resolution**: PCA is dropped entirely. LOF is run directly in the full 1290D
FFT space against sig_reference with no dimensionality reduction. In 1290D, the
temporal frequency structure of Δcx/Δcy (sustained drift for gliders, near-zero
for everything else) and S_lag_2/4/8/16 (period structure of oscillators) are
fully visible to LOF and correctly separate these classes. The failure was PCA
compression, not the FFT representation. No changes to Stage 1 or the dataset
are required.
